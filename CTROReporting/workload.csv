Same Lead Org (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center); Same PI (Andrew Vickers). Different NCT #'s and different lead org ID's. But the titles were almost identical. Only difference was one said \"A Feasibility Study\" while the other one didn't.
 
I accepted the submissions for several reasons:
1. Different NCT numbers
2. Accrual was different (1400 v. 300)
3. Study Design was different (Supportive Care v. Treatment)
4. Not to mention, both trials had amendments already accepted by us.

These are some of the reasons I accepted the trial.
